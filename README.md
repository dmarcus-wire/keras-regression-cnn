# CNN
- Regression with Keras and CNNs â€” training a CNN to predict house prices from image data
- Our CNN takes input from multiple images of the inside and outside of a home and outputs a predicted price using Keras and regression.
  
## Improvement from Regression
- Removing the fully-connected softmax classifier layer typically used for classification
- Replacing it with a fully-connected layer with a single node along with a linear activation function.
- Training the model with a continuous value prediction loss function such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, etc.
